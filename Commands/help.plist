# Help for the SQL Bundle

The _Execute Line / Selection as MySQL Query_ command takes the selected text or current line and submit it as a query to mysql.  It assumes that the `mysql` command line program is already in your `$PATH`.  Using the `--html` flag the output from the query is formated and displayed in an HTML window.

The command assumes the following environment variables are properly set:

* `$MYSQL_USER` — defaults to the value of `$USER`
* `$MYSQL_PWD ` — no default
* `$MYSQL_HOST` — defaults to localhost if not set
* `$MYSQL_PORT` — defaults to 3306 if not set
* `$MYSQL_DB  ` — no default

These variables may be set in the parent shell of TextMate, global variables in TextMate preferences, or as project local variables.

If you are a Postgres user and have the `psql8` command installed (as from [DarwinPorts](http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/) for example) You can also send commands to postgresql:

* `$PGUSER` — defaults to the value of `$USER`
* `$PGHOST` — defaults to localhost if not set
* `$PGPORT` — defaults to 3306 if not set
* `$PGDATABASE` — defaults to user

Postgres users should also note that there is not a command line argument to provide your password.  To use Postgresql on a database with a password from TextMate you should set up a `~/.pgpass` file.  This file should contain lines of the following format:

	hostname:port:database:username:password
